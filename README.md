I am a developer who works primarly on [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power) related projects ([EUROfusion](https://euro-fusion.org), [ITER](https://www.iter.org)). On a daily basis I am working with `Java`, `Python`, `C`, and `C++`. I also work on [bindings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding) betwen various languages.

I use `Vim`, prefer `2 spaces` over the `tab`, I like to [format code nicely](https://www.owsiak.org/modern-perl-best-practices-by-damian-conway/), and I use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to describe my work.

You can find more info about me at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkowsiak/). I publish occasionally blog posts at my [personal page](https://www.owsiak.org).

I am a fan of applying [soft skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills) to hard IT projects. As a team leader I am a huge fan of [Trello](https://trello.com)/[JIRA](https://jira.atlassian.com), [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results)s, [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) principles, and state of the art source code management.

Whenever I conduct a training, I try to put an effort to make it fully evidence-based.
